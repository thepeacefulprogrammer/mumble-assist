## Brainstorming

# Want to be able to upload a audio file of someone speaking

# Want to break that audio file into chunks based on completed sentences

# Want to be able to play each sentence separately using some kind of audio player controls

# prompt the user to start

# want to record audio

# analyze the audio and compare it to the original audio

# display the results
